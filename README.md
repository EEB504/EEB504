# EEB504

This is the [course website](https://eeb504.github.io/EEB504/) for "Scientific Computing for Biologists" at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://eeb.utk.edu/). Drs. [Charlotte Chang](http://charlottehchang.github.io), [Lou Gross](http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/), and [Nikhil Deshmukh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhil-d-aa55676/) are the course instructors.

Slides for Day 1, October 13, can be found at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/chwchang/EEB504git).

Our in-class exercises will consist of a mixture of lectures and interactive programming sessions using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). [QUBESHub](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/utk_eeb_504) will provide RStudio and jupyter support through their servers for the course exercises. Participants are more than welcome to work on the exercises locally, but using QUBESHub permits everyone to be engaged even if their local machine does not have the necessary languages and packages installed.

Day 2 Materials are in the folder titled [PyDataRF](https://github.com/EEB504/EEB504/tree/master/PyDataRF)

If you'd like to run Python and Jupyter notebook on your own computer, we recommend downloading the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) of Python for scientific computing. This installer will install base python, several data manipulation and plotting libraries, an IDE for writing code, and the Jupyter notebook viewer onto your computer. Be sure to use the Python 3.X version.  

To open a jupyter notebook, navigate to the folder that contains the notebook in your terminal and type the following command:

`jupyter notebook`  

Additionally, GitHub natively displays Jupyter notebooks in the browser.
