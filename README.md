# EEB504

This is the [course website](https://charlottehchang.github.io/EEB504/) for "Scientific Computing for Biologists" at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://eeb.utk.edu/). Drs. [Charlotte Chang](http://charlottehchang.github.io), [Lou Gross](http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/), and [Nikhil Deshmukh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhil-d-aa55676/) are the course instructors.

Our in-class exercises will consist of a mixture of lectures and interactive programming sessions using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). [QUBESHub](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/utk_eeb_504) will provide RStudio and jupyter support through their servers for the course exercises. Participants are more than welcome to work on the exercises locally, but using QUBESHub permits everyone to be engaged even if their local machine does not have the necessary languages and packages installed.
