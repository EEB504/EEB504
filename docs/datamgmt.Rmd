## Why should I care about data management?

* Project edits and manuscript revisions...sometimes many months (or years!) down the line
* Maximizing the benefit of your work to the scientific community and society
* Facilitate collaborations based on your contributions

[DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/data-life-cycle) has an excellent overview of the steps in a data management and analysis pipeline.

## Best practices

We will be presenting an overview of this [DataONE Primer](https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_BP_Primer_020212.pdf).

Another resource is [Shuai's AI & Data Blog](https://shuaiw.github.io/2017/07/30/versioning-data-science.html) which has practical insights from an experienced data scientist and startup founder.
