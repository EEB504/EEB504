# Random Forests for Supervised Learning

Overview:

* Best-in-class algorithm for classification and regression
* Generalizes well across domains 
* Runs efficiently on large data sets
* Avoids overfitting
* Not just a black box, but interpretable
* Can be used to inform data collection and analysis
